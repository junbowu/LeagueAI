# LeagueAI
Implementation of an A.I. Player for the videogame League of Legends based on Image Recognition using PyTorch

Demo video of Tensorflow implementation from 2017: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWFCaXfOTk

# Abstract
The task is to create an agent that is able to play 3rd person massive multiplayer online battle arena games (MOBA) like League of Legends, Dota 2 and Heroes of the Storm with the same input as a human player.
Image recognition is used to detect objects in the game environment.

# Installation
- TODO

# TODO
- Implement Yolo v3 object detection to replace old Tensorflow implementation
- Automatic training dataset generation
- Train model with new, larger dataset

# History

## 17.3.2019
- Creating new branch for pytorch object detection
